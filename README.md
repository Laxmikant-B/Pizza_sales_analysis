I analyzed old sales data for pizza from 2015 using a tool called MySQL Server.
I carefully looked through the data and found some useful information. After that, I double-checked the results by doing the same analysis again in Power BI.
This thorough process made sure that the insights we got from the data were correct and trustworthy.
